# Optimizing Mentor-student Communication Using LLM-Based Automated Labeling Information States
The appendix and a brief tutorial for the paper "Optimizing Mentor-student Communication Using LLM-Based Automated Labeling Information States"

## Overview
We provide the appendix here to show the messages that are used for testing ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude-3 and their answers to these messages.
